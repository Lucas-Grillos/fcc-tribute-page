                A timeline of Louis Pasteur's life
            </h3>
            <ul>
                <li><span class="date">1822 -</span> 
                    Louis was born on the 29th of December, in Dole, France.
                </li>
                <li><span class="date">1832 -</span> 
                    At the age of 9, Louis showed no particular interest as a scientist.
                    He did, however, show aptitude as an artist.
                </li>
                <li><span class="date">1839 -</span>
                    Louis is accepted into the College Royal at Besancon.   
                </li>
                <li><span class="date">1842 -</span>
                    Graduates with a BA and BSc with honoros in physics, mathematics, Latin, and drawing.
                </li>
                <li><span class="date">1843 -</span>
                    After passing with a very low score the previous year, Louis achieves high ranks on
                    the entrance exam to the École normale supérieure. 
                </li>
                <li><span class="date">1852 -</span>
                    Louis was appointed the chair of chemistry at the University of Strasbourg, where he had 
                    in 1948 been appointed a professor. In 1949, he had married the daughter of the universities
                    rector, Marie Laurent.
                </li>
                <li><span class="date">1854 -</span>
                    Pasteur is appointed professor of chemistry at the University of Lille. While in Lille, Louis
                    was asked to work on problems at nearby alcohol distillation. This lead him to studying issues
                    related to the souring of milk, caused by compounds such as lactic acid.
                </li>
                <li><span class="date">1857 -</span>
                    His previous studies lead Louis to coin the term Pasteur Effect; the unexpected discovery 
                    the fermentation process could be arrested by passing oxygen through the fermenting fluid.
                </li>
                <li><span class="date">1863 -</span>
                    Louis is personally requested by the emperor of France, Napoleon III, to investigate wine
                    contamination. Pasteur found it to be caused by microbes. To combat this, he invented a
                    process known as Pasteurization, where the wine was heated 120-140F to kill the microbes.
                    Today, this process is most universally used in milk to prevent the aging process.
                </li>
                <li><span class="date">1873 -</span>
                    In 1873, Louis Pasteur is appointed an associate member of the Académie de Médecine, to the
                    chagrin of the medical establishment for his advocacy of the germ theory of disease. 
                    Nonetheless, over the next decade, Pasteur developed the principle of vaccination and
                    helped contribute the burgeoning field of immunology.
                </li>
                <li><span class="date">1879 -</span>
                    Pasteur develops a vaccine for chicken cholera, by injecting chickens with an attenuated
                    form of the cultured virus. Later that year, he also began investigating anthrax.
                </li>
                <li><span class="date">1881 -</span>
                    Louis Pasteur's work on anthrax is vindicated when a batch of sheeps are exposed to the
                    virus. The sheep that had been vaccinated all survived, and the control group all died.
                </li>
                <li><span class="date">1885 -</span>
                    After several years of researching rabies, Pasteur vaccinates a young boy exposed to the
                    virus by a rabid dog. The result was so successful, that hundreds of other bite victims
                    were subsequently saved by Pasteur's vaccine, launching an era of preventive medicine.
                </li>
                <li><span class="date">1887 -</span>
                    Louis launches the Pasteur Institute, which he continued to work at until his death in
                    1895. The Pasteur Institute still exists today, and is responsible helping control 
                    diseases such as diptheria, tetanus, tuberculosis, poliomyelitis, influenza, and
                    yellow fever.
